# js-starter-kit
Starter kit that includes all tools required by a JS project

## Steps required when starting a new project

### 1. Chosing an IDE

Visual Studio Code is my choice since it has the following features:
- free
- fast
- built-in terminal
- Git integration
- Node integration
- plug-in ecosystem

It is important to define the same configuration for the IDE that can be shared accorss the team. In order to accomplish this do the following steps:
- go to Manage (buttom-left corner of the IDE)
- go to Settngs
- go to Workspace
- update all required settings
- save
- => VS will generate the following file '.vscode/settings.json'
