# JavaScript Starter Kit
Starter kit that includes all tools required by a JS project

## Steps required when starting a new project

### 1. Choose an IDE

Visual Studio Code is my choice since it has the following features:
- free
- fast
- built-in terminal
- Git integration
- Node integration
- plug-in ecosystem

It is important to define the same configuration for the IDE that can be shared accorss the team. In order to accomplish this do the following steps:
- go to:  Manage (buttom-left corner of the IDE) -> Settngs -> Workspace
- update all required settings
- hit save
- => VS will generate the following file '.vscode/settings.json' (see the file in the current project)

NOTE: An alternative way to add an editor config is using an .editorconfig file added to the root of the project (more info can be found at https://editorconfig.org/)
